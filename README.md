<h2>JsonToPostgres</h2>

JsonToPostgres will build actual tables from PostgreSQL JsonFormats and create realational tables based on them. This tool should be used when all data is ready
for conversion. It is useful in cases where dynamic data is written to a NoSQL database and reliable relational data is required as input elsewhere.

The tool is written in Scala.
